# SuperRin System
A platformer game inspired by the song SUPERHERO by Mellowcle for the Magical Mirai 2024 Contest. This game was written completely from scratch, without the use of an existing game engine!

If seburoh never has to code collision detection again they will be very happy.

# Local Run Instructions
If you download this repository and intend to run the code locally, follow these steps:
1. After downloading the code, `npm install` to install required dependancies.
2. When complete, `npm run dev` to run the game.
